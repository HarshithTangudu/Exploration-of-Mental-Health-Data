# Project Title: Exploration of Mental Health Data using Random Forest and XGBoost

## Introduction
This project aims to explore and analyze mental health data using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost. The goal is to build predictive models to understand the factors affecting mental health and to predict mental health outcomes.

## Files in the Repository
- **mental-health-data.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the data exploration, preprocessing, and model building steps.
- **rf_submission.csv**: CSV file containing the predictions made by the Random Forest model.
- **sample_submission.csv**: Sample submission file for reference.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset used for making predictions.
- **train.csv**: Training dataset used for building the models.
- **xgb_submission.csv**: CSV file containing the predictions made by the XGBoost model.

## Data Exploration
The data exploration phase involves:
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Understanding the structure and features of the data.
3. Performing descriptive statistics.
4. Visualizing the data to identify patterns and correlations.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
1. Handling missing values.
2. Encoding categorical variables.
3. Normalizing or scaling numerical features.
4. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Building
Two machine learning models are built and compared:
1. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
2. **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm that is efficient and scalable.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of the Random Forest and XGBoost models are compared to determine the best model for predicting mental health outcomes.

## Results
The results of the models are saved in the respective submission files (`rf_submission.csv` and `xgb_submission.csv`). These files contain the predicted mental health outcomes for the test dataset.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Random Forest and XGBoost for exploring and predicting mental health data. The insights gained from this analysis can help in understanding the factors affecting mental health and in making informed decisions for mental health interventions.
